0. Introduction

A 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube has six faces, each with a different color.",
There are 3 types of pieces: center pieces, edge pieces, and corner pieces.",
The center pieces are \"fixed\". They won't move relatively to each other.",
On a scrambled cube, the center pieces indicate the correct colors on each face.",
Each piece has its own single correct position, restricted by its colors and the center pieces.",
Controlling the Rubik's Cube with keyboard follows closely how one hold and turn a cube. It gives a more pleasant user experience as you follow through this guide.

exercise:
- follow as the illustration cube moves
- click on where the highlighted piece should go to

1. first cross
   - move one in top layer to make it correct (no glance necessary)
   - move one in top layer to a further place (need glance/rotate cube)
   - move the remaining piece to the top cross from middle layer (when 3 are correct) - direct
   - move the remaining piece to the top cross from middle layer (when 3 are correct) - at another pos
   - move a second piece from middle layer to top - direct
   - move a second piece from middle layer to top - at another pos
   - move a piece from bottom to middle (simple), free to move -> then to the correct position
   - move a piece from bottom to middle (harder, 2 correct)
   - move a piece from bottom to middle (hardest, i.e. final piece, 3 correct)
   - move a wrong piece from top layer down
   - 3 top pieces with either 1 correct or 2 correct, fix these 3
   - final -> produce the cross
2. middle-layer edges
   - top piece aligned, right hand side
   - same for left hand side
   - ask to do one piece in top layer (reminding to think left/right side)
   - do another one (other side)
   - unlucky case, move arbitrary one from top to middle to swap
   - final -> produce the middle layer
3. top-layer edges
   - move middle layer to top (color correct)
   - move middle layer to top (color incorrect)
   - move middle layer to top + choose a good piece down
   - middle layer is itself, move arbitrarily
   - intermediate -> produce >= 3 top edges
   - final two edges, 3 practices
   - final two edges unlucky case
   - final -> produce 4 edges
4. corners
   - put one corner to its top
   - mirrored
   - put one corner to the other top position
   - mirrored
   - more practice * 3 (guided, asking to put that piece)
   - find a suitable face, and make 4 correct corners
   - selecting a good piece down
     - case 1 having both top/facing
     - case 2 only top
     - case 3 only facing
   - selecting a good piece down (mirrored)
     - case 1 having both top/facing
     - case 2 only top
     - case 3 only facing
   - intermediate -> produce >= 6 corners
5. final corners
   - (first state objective - same method for moving corners, but think which/where to move)
   - place the cube correctly (selecting a top face)
     - 2 exercises (need confirmation)
   - move the top layer, such that same vertical layer and top color facing u (like how u select good piece)
     - 4 exercises (need confirmation)
   - rotate the correct face
     - 3 exercises
   - step one
     - 5 exercises
   - step two
     - 4 exercises
